- Floating point error

Questions

- How to pause game execution? (the compiler should help you avoid big errors)

- Why is there a typedef uchar for unsigned char?

- Why do we check for '\0' but in debbuging that does not appear as the last character of the string?

- Should I also add the character '\0' at the end of the text property?

- I want:
	- Create a function in only one place (if i have to make changes i only want to change one)
	- Avoid the time of calling a function (as if it was coded in all the places)
- I'm thinking that there might be a way to tell the compiler to do just that. Inline might be the solution but i dont' understand it fully.
- Done example: string class > CalculateLenght()
- Something I would also like to make like that: string class > Associate values() (after calculating lenght in the constructor, it repeats in 2 instances of the code)
